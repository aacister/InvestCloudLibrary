Requirements:  
1. Show a list of categories on the left  
2. Show applets that belong to that category on the right  
3. Selecting category should update list of applets on the right for that category and filtered by 
search criteria  
4. Use Bootstrap (or similar) framework to match the style in the screenshots as closely as possible 
5. Add search functionality. See LibraryFiltered.png for reference.  
Searching will:  
(a) Filter applets on the right by applet name from search field  
(b) Filter categories to only include the ones that contain applets matching search. 
Counts should reflect how many applets belong to that category.  
(c) When search is present categories with 0 applets must be hidden.
